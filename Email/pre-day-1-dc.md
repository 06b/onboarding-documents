Your first day at 18F will begin with a mandatory orientation administered by GSA HR.

## Day 1: GSA and 18F Orientation

**Time:** 7:45 AM ET

**Where:** 1800 F Street NW, Washington DC. Tell the security guard you’re here for New Hire Orientation. You will have to show a photo ID to enter the building.

**Bring:** I-9 form with two forms of proper identification (see [acceptable documents](http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents)). *Note: It's likely that you already filled out an I-9 and emailed it to [gsaonboarding@gsa.gov](mailto:gsaonboarding@gsa.gov) To be safe, it's good to have a printed copy too.*

**Orientation:** After you check in with security, someone from GSA HR will meet you at the front desk and take you to your orientation. The length of orientation may vary, but generally takes a few hours. You’ll take an oath of office and learn about the government’s ethics policies. You will also submit any the paperwork you received before starting work that you have not emailed to [gsaonboarding@gsa.gov](mailto:gsaonboarding@gsa.gov). (Our guide for filling that paperwork out is [here](https://github.com/18F/onboarding-documents/blob/master/Forms/gsa-onboarding-forms.md).)

**Badge info:** You will receive an email at your personal and work account when your badge is ready to be picked up. If you've already received this email, we recommend scheduling your pick-up appointment in the morning before orientation starts. Don't worry if it's not ready on your first day.

## After orientation ends

After orientation, your buddy will walk with you to 18F.  

On your first day, you'll complete all of the tasks on [this checklist](https://github.com/18F/onboarding-documents/blob/master/Checklists/new-hire-checklist.md#first-day). 

**This is really important** - you must set up GSA's 2FA (task 9) inside a federal building; otherwise, you will not be able to access Google Apps or your email from outside the building.
