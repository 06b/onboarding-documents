Hi **[NAME]**,

We’re so excited you’re joining the 18F team within the General Services Administration (GSA)! I wanted to give you some details about what to expect at orientation on your first day of work, which is scheduled for **[DATE]**.

## Day 1: GSA Orientation

Your first day at 18F will begin with a mandatory orientation administered by GSA HR. You should have received information about the location and time of your orientation in your offer letter or through a phone call with your regional GSA HR representative. If you have any questions about where to go and when, please let me know!

**Bring:** I-9 form with two forms of proper identification (see [acceptable documents](http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents)). The I-9 form must be verified in person before you can sign, so wait to fill it out until you arrive at orientation.

*Note: It's likely that you already filled out an I-9 and emailed it to [gsaonboarding@gsa.gov](mailto:gsaonboarding@gsa.gov) To be safe, it's good to have a printed copy too.*

**Orientation:** After you check in with security, report to your assigned orientation room. The length of orientation may vary, but generally takes a few hours. You’ll take an oath of office and learn about the government’s ethics policies. You will also submit any the paperwork you received before starting work that you have not emailed to [gsaonboarding@gsa.gov](mailto:gsaonboarding@gsa.gov). (Our guide for filling that paperwork out is [here](https://github.com/18F/onboarding-documents/blob/master/Forms/gsa-onboarding-forms.md).) 

**Your computer**: 

You can pick up your computer ___________. Please call __________ at __________ if you have any questions.

OR

Your computer was FedExed to your home and should arrive on XXX.

**NOTE: Before you leave the federal building on your first day, you must set up two-factor authentication. Instructions are attached. You will not be able to read your GSA email or access anything on the GSA network if you do not set this up before you leave the federal building. Please call ______ at _______ if you have any trouble with this.**
