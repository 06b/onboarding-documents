Hi **[NAME]**,

We’re so excited you’re joining the 18F team within the General Services Administration (GSA)! I wanted to give you some details about what to expect at orientation on your first day of work, which is scheduled for **[DATE]**.

## Day 1: GSA and 18F Orientation

Your first day at 18F will begin with a mandatory orientation administered by GSA HR.

**Time:** 1:00 PM - 4:30 PM

**Where:** 230 S Dearborn, on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. GSA onboarding is typically done on alternating Mondays in Room 3722, in the NW corner of the 37th floor. You will be required to go through security and show ID. If you have any trouble, call or email GSA HR Specialist Theresa Gibbs. Her number is (312) 485-3275 and her email is theresa.gibbs@gsa.gov.

**Bring:** I-9 form with two forms of proper identification (see [acceptable documents](http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents)).

*Note: It's likely that you already filled out an I-9 and emailed it to [gsaonboarding@gsa.gov](mailto:gsaonboarding@gsa.gov) To be safe, it's good to have a printed copy too.*

**What to expect at orientation:** At GSA Orientation, you'll learn about GSA and the legal and ethical considerations of working for the federal government. You'll also take an oath of office, and hand in any paperwork you haven't yet sent to [gsaonboarding@gsa.gov](mailto:gsaonboarding@gsa.gov).

## Day 2

Please arrive at 8AM CST on your second day of work. Ethan Heppner, 18F Chicago’s office operations coordinator, will help walk you get on the GSA network and work through the tasks on your **CHECKLIST**.

Attached is a note that will help you with your second day tasks. **This is really important** - you must set up GSA's 2FA (task 9) inside the federal building; otherwise, you will not be able to access Google Apps or your email from outside the building. 

Have a great first day!
