Hi **[NAME]**,

We’re so excited you’re joining the 18F team within the General Services Administration (GSA)! I wanted to give you some details about what to expect at orientation on your first day of work, which is scheduled for **[DATE]**.

## Day 1: GSA and 18F Orientation

Your first day at 18F will begin with a mandatory orientation administered by GSA HR.

**Time:** 1:00 PM

**Where:** 230 S Dearborn, on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. GSA onboarding is typically done on alternating Mondays in Room 3722, in the NW corner of the 37th floor.

**Bring:** I-9 form with two forms of proper identification (see [acceptable documents](http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents)).

*Note: It's likely that you already filled out an I-9 and emailed it to [gsaonboarding@gsa.gov](mailto:gsaonboarding@gsa.gov) To be safe, it's good to have a printed copy too.*

**Security:** You will be required to go through security and show ID.

**Orientation:** GSA onboarding is typically done on alternating Mondays at 1:00 PM in Room 3722, in the NW corner of the 37th floor.

**Your second day:** To allow yourself enough time to get set up on the GSA network, please arrive at 8 AM on the second day of your first week and Ethan Heppner, 18F Chicago’s office operations coordinator, will help walk you through the tasks on your checklist.

Attached is a note that will help you with your second day tasks. **This is really important** - you must set up GSA's 2FA (task 9) inside a federal building; otherwise, you will not be able to access Google Apps or your email from outside the building. 

Have a great first day! 

- **[NAME]**
