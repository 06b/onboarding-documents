## Day 1: GSA and 18F Orientation

Your first day at 18F will begin with a mandatory orientation administered by GSA HR.

**Time:** 1:00 PM - 4:30 PM

**Where:** 230 S Dearborn, on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. GSA onboarding is typically done on alternating Mondays in Room 3722, in the NW corner of the 37th floor. You will be required to go through security and show ID. If you have any trouble, call or email GSA HR Specialist Theresa Gibbs. Her number is (312) 485-3275 and her email is theresa.gibbs@gsa.gov.

**Bring:** I-9 form with two forms of proper identification (see [acceptable documents](http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents)).

**What to expect at orientation:** At GSA Orientation, you'll learn about GSA and the legal and ethical considerations of working for the federal government. You'll also take an oath of office, and hand in any paperwork you haven't yet sent to [gsaonboarding@gsa.gov](mailto:gsaonboarding@gsa.gov). (Our guide for filling that paperwork out is [here](https://github.com/18F/onboarding-documents/blob/master/Forms/gsa-onboarding-forms.md).)

**Badge info:** You will receive an email at your personal and work account when your badge is ready to be picked up. If you've already received this email, we recommend scheduling your pick-up appointment in the morning before orientation starts. Don't worry if it's not ready on your first day. 

## Day 2

Please arrive at 8AM CST on your second day of work. Ethan Heppner, 18F Chicagoâ€™s office operations coordinator, will help walk you get on the GSA network and work through the tasks on your [checklist](). If you run into any difficulties, Ethan's email is ethan.heppner@gsa.gov and his phone number is 312-887-1330.

**This is really important** - you must set up GSA's 2FA (task 9) inside the federal building; otherwise, you will not be able to access Google Apps or your email from outside the building. [Instructions]()
