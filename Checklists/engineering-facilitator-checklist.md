Engineering Facilitator Checklist
================================

*Note:* This is a suggested format for check-ins:


- Engineer explains something they learned since the last check-in (could be technical, about gov in general, organizational)
- Explain something the engineer did well since the last check in and why.
- Discussion of any issues, roadblocks, needs, etc.
- Chunk of time dedicated to one thing the engineer can focus improving between now and the next check-in (could be technical or organizational)
